			<h1>Accessability Research</h1>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>	
						<h3>1. What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?</h3>
						<p>
						To make my demo app more accessible I need to ad more detailed tags and be more descriptive when I am laying out my code and adding text and titles to anchor tags and things like that.  I just need to change my mindset from only coders are going to see this to I might have someone looking at my site or app that has a disability.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>2.	Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</h3>
						<p>
						From the videos I watched the main thing that annoyed me was the voice.  I know that most software will allow you to alter the voice from male to female but they donâ€™t sound natural.  There has to be a way to use a similar voice technology as the Turn-by-Turn navigation industry, and like Siri from Apple, where the voices sound more natural.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>3.	Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
						<p>
						Most Android and iOS devices have a large number of features that assist with accessibility issues.  Both have software that act similar to screen readers, as well as different options for the visually impaired.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>4.	Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
						<p>
						Android has a really nice app build into it called Talkback that is basically a screen reader for your Android device. There is also an app called SMSpeaker from Ideal Group, Inc that will read all incoming text messages.
