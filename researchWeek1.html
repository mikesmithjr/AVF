					<h3>1. What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the 		use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</h3>
					<p>
					If you are only using HTML/CSS/JS and not something like PhoneGap you can access things like touch, drag, and click or tap events.  You can also use the native audio and video players and notifications.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>2. What types of features do you think will pair well together in an app?</h3>
					<p>
					I like the idea of combining the contacts and geolocation. Tying geolocation and notifications to alert when you have arrived at a specific location would be cool.

					<h3>3. Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</h3>
					<p>
					In my CRUD I have a list of doctors' offices and hospitals that would be nice to give a map and directions when the user chooses one of those.  I think it would be nice if my user could take a picture of their blood sugar meter screen and attach it to their log entry.
					</p>

					<h3>4. Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</h3>
					<p>
					One of the big 'lessons learned' I would say is that you need to get the framework set and functional before adding pretty stuff. This way it is easier to debug later and you can get graded on something that is functional event though it might not be pretty. Also something that I learned the hard way is that sometimes you need to get up and walk away from the screen and take a break. I spent hours one night trying to fix a code issue until I just went to bed. When I looked at the code the next day it was something so simple that I was angry with myself.
