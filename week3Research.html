			<h1>Market Research</h1>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>	
						<h3> 1. What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</h3>
						<p>
						Finding the stats for US information was the easiest of the bunch.  I have searched for many hours now and still have been unable to find reliable info on many other countries. What I found was that in the US the most popular categories are games; news; maps; social networking and music.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>2. What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan? </h3>
						<p>
						I have searched for many hours and was unable to find a source for any Japanese app info.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>3. What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</h3>
						<p>
						After many hours of search I was able to find some info on application categories in the UK.  What I found was that games, education and books are the top selling categories in the UK.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>4. Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed? </h3>
						<p>
						Based on the information that I found I would say that most people worldwide use their mobile devices for gaming as much or more than purpose built mobile gaming consoles.  It looks like the UK does have a strong tie to using their devices for educational purposes as well.  The US is also interested in world events and with the popularity of maps I would say traveling is also important.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>5. What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development? </h3>
						<p>
						The latest version of Android is 4.1 aka Jelly Bean which only has a 1.8% global market share.  Android 2.3.3 aka Gingerbread is the most popular with about a 47% market share.  I did see some fluctuations in those numbers but I have given an average of what I found.  As far as impacting development I would say that even though we would all like to take advantage of the latest version and use its features in our apps it would be unwise to ignore the fact that most Android users are still on an older version of the software.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>6. What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development? </h3>
						<p>
						Without a reliable source of data to separate individual markets from the global market I can give you the numbers world wide.  The average world wide cost per MB is $0.03US, with each smartphone user using around 1GB of data per month.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>7. And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</h3>
						<p>
						I would most likely choose some sort of game for an app topic and would probably launch with an Android version first since it does hold a slight lead in global market share over iOS.
